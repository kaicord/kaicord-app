		"name": "W…™ ü ü…™·¥Ä·¥ç",
		"content": "One of the main ideas is remote working yeah. Virtualised desktops have long been popular for a few reasons:\n - Centrally manage software + updates\n - Client devices can be low power, the cost goes towards servers which are more economical \n - It's effectively like a VPN, but for your whole desktop + applications\n\nAzure have an offering that's existed for a while: https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/virtual-desktop/\n\nI think Windows 365's aim is to provide a better platform for this which can also be sold to the commerical market. If your desktop is in the cloud, it's incredibly convenient to be mobile between PCs and Laptops (Probably even Chromebooks and other low powered devices) without having to reinstall, change config etc\n\nThe one downside is it won't work without internet. But that's an increasingly rare situation for people nowadays"

		"content": "I was just reading an article about it. It‚Äôs really interesting how the whole world is moving towards virtualised environments. Happening with gaming, and now more so with work. It makes sense however i don‚Äôt think it‚Äôll catch on straight away. It‚Äôs taking us long enough to convince a client to move from on prem exchange to 365. It would be nice to see clients get a powerful system, but be able to control it using say an iPad. Only issue is as you say internet - not sure how you‚Äôd get around that? Because like if 365 goes down you can still get work done just not emails, whereas here if windows 365 goes down that‚Äôs your whole work"

I'm not sure what the solution is other than to rely on Microsoft's SLAs. Can't find an SLA online but I can imagine it'll be the top 99%, hopefully with at least 3 9s on the end"
